   <h3> Impact of computing on society </h3>
   &nbsp;
   <div class="e">
      <h4> Similar to most other forms of technology, computing technologies also have societal implications. Both of them and society have an impact on them. The way individuals interact with one another, their living spaces, and how they manage their time, communities, and jobs have all been altered by computers. In turn, society has shaped computer development by dictating how individuals need to absorb information. Technology for computers has developed to address particular issues in human society. A wide range of computing technologies, such as digital video and audio, mobile computing devices, games, supercomputers, graphics processors, and cell phones, have consequently been developed in response to societal demands and interests. </h4>

  <h3> INTRODUCTION TO IT BASICS:</h3>
  &nbsp;
  <div class="f">
      <h4> 
          •	<i> Hardware </i> - The physical components of a computer system are called hardware. Hardware includes both the internal parts of a computer and the external parts that interface with it, like printers, cables, and monitors.  Printers are programmed using a programming language. The printer outputs the outcome after interpreting the software. A computer cable is a wire that has an intended purpose for a computer. For instance, it might be a power or video cable. The computer manufacturing industry uses a wide variety of cables and wires. A monitor is a type of electronic visual computer display that consists of a screen, circuitry, and the case in which that circuitry is included. 
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          •	<i> Software </i> - Software instructs the computer on what actions to do, but the level to which this is achieved varies among software types. 
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          •   <i> Networking </i>– A network, as used in information technology, is any arrangement of two or more computer systems connected by a wired or wireless connection. A pair of computers linked together via a cable forms the most basic kind of network. Peer-to-peer networks are the name given to this kind of network. In this network, there is no hierarchy and every member has the same powers. Every computer can share resources like disc space, programs, and peripheral devices (printers, etc.) with other computers and can access each other's data. There are types of networks:
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <div class="g">
      <h4>
          -	<i> Local Area Network </i> – A Local Area Network also known as LAN, can be small or large and it is a group of linked devices in a single physical space, like a house, office, or building. 
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          -	<i> Wireless Local Area Network </i> - A collection of collocated PCs or other devices that create a network using radio signals as opposed to wired connections is known as a wireless local-area network, or WLAN. Wi-Fi network is the best type of WLAN. 
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          -	<i> Metropolitan Area Network </i> - A computer network called a metropolitan area network (MAN) links computers within a metropolitan location, which can be any large area with several buildings, several cities and villages, or just one large city. a MAN is larger than a Local Area Network (LAN) but smaller than Wide Area Network (WAN).

      <h4>
          <u>Role of IT in modern organizations</u> - These days, information technology (IT) is a crucial component of any corporate plan. IT is important to many types of businesses, from large multinationals that manage databases and mainframe systems to small companies with a single computer.
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          <u>Communication Between Employees, Suppliers, and Customers</u> - Employees can now communicate via live chat, online meetings, and video conferencing thanks to the evolution of several additional communications tools over time. Smartphones and Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phones provide even more advanced means of communication for staff members. 
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          <u>Inventory Management Systems</u> - Organizations that manage their inventory must keep just enough inventory on hand to satisfy demand without going overboard. Inventory management systems keep track of how much of each item a business keeps on hand, and when the numbers drop below a preset limit, an order for more stock is placed.
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          <u>Data Management Systems</u> - Document mailing and spacious file rooms with rows of filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past. The majority of businesses today save digital copies of their papers on servers and other storage devices. Everyone in the organization, regardless of location, has quick access to these documents.
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>
          <u>Management Information Systems</u> - Data storage is only useful if it is put to good use. Both the tactical execution of their strategy and their strategic planning process involve the use of such data by progressive companies. Businesses can monitor sales information, costs, and productivity levels with the use of Management Information Systems (MIS).
      </h4>
      &nbsp;
      <h4> 
          <u>Customer Relationship Management</u> - Businesses are using IT to enhance the way they plan and handle client interactions. CRM (customer relationship management) systems record all of the interactions a business has with its customers in order to facilitate a more fulfilling relationship.
